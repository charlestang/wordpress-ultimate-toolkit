=== Query Box ===
The base layer is the query box. Currently, the query box object consist of 8 parameterized 
database query. These queries are the core of this plugin. The query box object can be used 
independently if you think the whole plugin is verbose.

Each function in query box is a simple encapsulation of a sql statement. A return of this 
kind of function is a database record, which is a object whose data members corespond to 
fields of a table in database.

=== Template Tags ===
The second layer is a set of [http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags template tags]. These 
tags call functions in the query box, process the result and print out well formated html. 
Template tags don't work without the query box.

Template tags are encapsulations of querys in the query box. They are designed for theme 
and plugin developers.

=== Widgets ===
The third layer of this plugin is a set of widgets. They are designed for end users. All of 
them have a control panel, which can be used by end users to custom behaviors of the widget.
